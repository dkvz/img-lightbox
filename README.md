# img-lightbox

## Build requirements
* NodeJS

## Installing dependencies
Run:
```
npm install
```

## Using the component
ADD TEH STYLES

## Remarks
I'm not using the Shadow DOM on purpose. Styles are a mess as a result.

## Resources
- The hourglass icon has been modified from the GPL-licensed file here: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Circle-icons-hourglass.svg

## TODO
- [ ] Test on all browsers
- [ ] Don't forget to register the keyboard events
- [ ] We should probably check for web component support before trying to register the whole thing when using it in prod
- [x] Disable overflow on the fullscreen overlay
- [ ] Make a shadow DOM version
- [ ] Add support for lightbox over an svg tag instead of img
- [ ] Support for iframes would be really cool
